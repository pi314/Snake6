Snake 6
=======

This is my previous work, [Snake 4.6](http://www.nba.nctu.edu.tw/~pi314/pi314/Game/Snake/Snake_IV_6.exe)

[And this is Snake 5](http://www.nba.nctu.edu.tw/~pi314/pi314/Game/Snake/Snake_V.html)

Snake 5 is a milestone, my first step into the world of HTML/CSS/JavaScript,
(And my first step out of windows API)

I love my Snake 5, but it's not a successful work, because one day I tried to change something, and a feature, my favorite feature, portal, just broken.

This time I want to combine two wonderful features in Snake 4.6 and Snake 5, AI and portal, into Snake 6.

Hope I will achieve this wish.
