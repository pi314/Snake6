Snake 6
=======

This is my previous work, `Snake 4.6 <http://pi314.github.io/Game/Snake/Snake_IV_6.exe>`_

`And this is Snake 5 <http://pi314.github.io/Game/Snake/Snake_V.html>`_

Snake 5 is a milestone, it's my first step into the world of HTML/CSS/JavaScript (And my first step out of windows API)

I love my Snake 5, but it's not a successful work, because one day I tried to change something, and my favorite feature, portal, just broken.

This time I want to combine two wonderful features in Snake 4.6 and Snake 5, which are AI and portal, into Snake 6.

Hope I can realize this wish.
